        <h1>Watershed</h1>

        <p>
  Watershed is a certain way of life and world view.  In the Watershed world view, the primary place we find ourselves in is literally a watershed: the area defined by how water flows from the sky to the sea.  In addition to our place in a world of flowing water, our cosmology is defined by a "trash feed", the ongoing flow of materials that exists in the present consumer society consisting of digging things up, setting them on fire, and burying them.  In the methodology of the Watershed, we use our information systems to reshape the flow of the water and trash into new value structures which enable us to parse Things in a post scarcity environment, where one thing is never just one thing.  
        </p>
        <p>
    Much of what we build here is in the form of Things, Links, and Generators.  A Generator is a entity which can generate Things or other Generators.  All Things have generators, which allows them to replicate(hence generators are also called replicators, depending on context).  Generators can be a piece of software on a website, a local piece of software on a computer, a set of oral instructions shared by an existing user, written instructions, machinery for automated industrial production, or any number of other machines or information structures.  Links are elements which simply point to another Thing, Generator, or Document.  Links can be a hyperlink to a thing or page or generator, a QR code, a written URL on a  physical object, an email or direct message, a map showing the location of a thing(treasure map!), a sign to catch the attention of a passerby etc.  All Generators are also things, and thus have a generator which creates them.  All things are also made up of many things, each of which has generators, etc.</p>
    <p>
    Laws which we use to understand the Universe we define around our minds in the Watershed are all based on the following nine basic Laws:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>EVERYTHING IS RECURSIVE</li>
        <LI>EVERYTHING IS FRACTAL</LI>
        <LI>EVERYTHING IS PHYSICAL</LI>
        <LI>NO MONEY</LI>
        <LI>NO MINING</LI>
        <LI>NO PROPERTY</LI>
        <LI>LOOK TO THE FUNGI</LI>
        <LI>LOOK TO THE INSECTS</LI>
        <LI>LANGUAGE IS HOW THE MIND PARSES REALITY</LI>
    </ul>
    
          <p>
    Documents are things.  Documents which are of a form where a bunch of raw HTML with minimal style information and no page layout information is intended to be inside a DIV element which scrolls are called scrolls.  This is the basic structure which allows us to replicate the functionality of popular social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Wordpress etc. Scrolls are divided into two types of thing: tales and lore. Generators are a form of lore, because they are information about the action of using a thing, which includes creating the thing.  Tales encompass social media of the normal kind, a recording in time of events with personal meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is important to note that things are all made up of many things which are also made up of still other things.  All things are many things at once.  This is in direct contrast to the dominant cosmology of today.  As an example consider a "glass of water".  In the dominant cosmology this is a compound thing made up of two things, the water and the glass.  Both are largely defined by who "owns" them, and both exist largely in isolation.  The water is not part of a global water flow, and your local river system which channeled that flow is not part of the thing defined by "glass of water".  Nor are the dirt smudges on the glass, the bacteria in those smudges, the minerals in the water, the ripples across the surface of the water, the natural sound vibrations of the glass, the heat in the system which makes it have a given temperature, the light bouncing off it that allows us to see it etc.  At first glance it appears that narrowing our focus to just "glass" and "water" as unitary things is helpful for getting through our day, but these linguistic choices have dire consequences for our way of life.  They reflect an ideology in which the only things that exist are the things which one may "own".  In the Watershed cosmology it is relevant to consider how one thing is made of many things because it enables us to parse all that information into information systems which facilitate generating more things.  In order to do that we must give context to things, and connect them with all the other things we might need to generate more of those things.  This means we take a world view which borrows a lot from the ideas of quantum information, although technically this is not literally a quantum system in the strict sense(although all systems are quantum of course).  This also justifies my interest in quantum art as a pure art form, rather than as a system to help people build the dreaded "quantum computer".

        Given this Universe of Things which are made up of other things which are also parts of other things etc. we must consider the implications for how we parse language using modern information technology. To consider this we begin by looking at the physical nature of modern networks and where they're going.  Suppose, as industry people all assume, that we are nearing a time where there are 100-1000 billion "things" in the IoT or "internet of things".  That means that for every human mind in existence there are more than 10 unix servers which can serve web information to the Internet or some equivalent local mesh network.  Each of these can be assumed to have at least 1 gigabyte of storage capacity. A Thing in the Watershed cosmology will be defined by a collection of generators, scrolls, etc. and these all add up to typically much less than 1 megabyte, often only 0.1 megabytes or so. Thus each node in the emerging IoT network can hold several thousand Things in the Watershed cosmology.  But with between dozens and hundreds or even thousands of possible servers per human mind this means there are 10s of thousands of things per human mind <em>for every single human mind on the planet.</em>  This means that our current ideas about "property" and "ownership" are not just obsolete because they lead to a "inequality" in some mathematical sense but because they are cognitively impossible.  The human mind simply cannot and does not want to parse this size of universe.  Thus we are presented with the need to replace the "economy" with a system of organizing information which simply makes some sense of this effectively infinite universe of Things.  
    </p>
    <p>
        While this sounds like a daunting task, we make it easier by focusing in a fractal way for each human mind on what we need here and now to survive and thrive.  When we focus on our own mental universes we find that they are small enough to actually be spanned by a reasonable space of information: things, documents, generators, and so on.  It's an almost circular statement: the universe of things the mind can parse can be parsed by the mind.  Thus it is not unreasonable to expect to be able to build a language and information system which can put all this in one place and in one language.  That is the task here.  The branches of the Watershed Tree listed here represent one human mind, that of Lafe Spietz, born 1976 in Juneau Alaska, who's mostly built technology.

        <h2>Watershed Tree Branches:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Metamap: a metalanguage for constructing maps.
            </li>
            <li>Action geometry: an alternate approach to geometric constructions which emphasizes action over concept, form or formalism. Action Geometry consists of a set of shapes, actions, and objects, and is physically transmitted via a set of cards drawn and colored on cardstock cut to about 3.5 by 5.5 inches, like a Tarot deck.</li>

            <li>
                Quantum art: This consists of art useful for quantum information science, namely Geometron software to create relevant vector graphics for quantum computation graphical communication, CSS/HTML/JavaScript for making representations of quantum states using superposition of bitmap images using CSS transparency properties, and x3d(formerly known as VRML) code for making 3d representations of various Hilbert spaces mapped into generalized spheres.
