<h2>Card Deck</h2>

<p>
    The Watershed Network Card Deck is a means of transmitting information based on a deck of cards you make yourself which are roughly similar to Tarot cards.  As a baseline they are 3.5 inches by 5.5 inches, made from cardstock.  Cards generally have a more graphics oriented side and a more text oriented side and are colored in with crayons, markers, colored pencils, or paint.
