<h2>Server</h2>
<p>
    Servers are what run the Internet.  They are computers that store and deliver the actual information that goes into a web page that is displayed on your phone, tablet, or computer.  Servers for large centralized networks are huge, complex, and have a centralized power structure and decentralized physical architecture.  They all run the same software, and that software has to be carefully guarded lest the whole system be compromised in some way.
</p>    
<p>
    In the Watershed Network we also use web servers but change nearly all the assumptions of the centralized commercial networks. Some of our assumptions are listed below:
</p>

<h4>Assumptions of Watershed Network for Servers</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Due to massive over production of computer hardware globally we will soon live in a world where there are many computers capable of running a web server for every single human on the planet.</li>
    <li>Thus the value of any one potential web server should be considered to be next to zero, as a quasi-disposable resource to be used, wiped clean and re-used like a dry erase board.</li>
    <li>The purpose of "network security" is to protect data and money which is mostly controlled by centralized power networks, and if we seek a world of plenty this model is nonsense.</li>
    <li>We assume that anyone who <em>does not</em> write code for a living is basically well meaning and worthy of trust.  We will therefore have no passwords or log ins or personal accounts, just public information servers which can be edited by anyone at any time anonymously with minimal computer skill on a Watershed Terminal.</li>
    <li>Conversely, we will assume that since the source of all money in the Computer industry is using threats of violence to extract value from people who do real work and give it to those who claim rights to so-called "intellectual property" that every single person who derives their material wealth from this system is Evil until they prove otherwise, generally by quitting that job permanently and committing to devoting their life to fighting that system and everyone in it. </li>
    <li>We assume that code literacy is something that can spread to a large fraction of the total population, with ultimately as a rough estimate about 1% of the users being able to create new code and edit code at a deep level and a good solid half of all users able to at least edit html using a half a dozen of the most common tags like p and img. Thus for a network of 6 billion people, there should be about 60 million active code editors who can make their own new applications from scratch using all 5 elements of Watershed Code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Server Choices</h2>
<p>The most basic choice to get started quickly in this system is to get an account on a free webserver and use the file "replicator.php" to replicate one of the basic web pages here.  That process is in the replication path of all the various elements in this Basis Set so it will not be repeated in words here, you'll learn by doing as someone shows you.  The other most straightforward choice is to run the server on localhost on your phone, making your Watershed Terminal also into your Watershed Server.  The problem with this is that no one else can see what you write, but that can also be useful!  In general if you're going to do a lot of work in the Watershed Network it just makes sense to figure out how to set up our servers on every machine you use regularly.  If you want to scale up a network, it can make sense to get a cheap paid plan.  Cheap plans can be as little as 10 dollars a month, so if you can find 10 users they can each chip in a buck a month and you're running and if you <em>don't</em> have 10 users, you're probably fine with the free hosting account at 000webhost.com.  Ultimately as our Network grows, these servers run by commercial companies and on our home computers will be replaced by hacked "internet of things" devices which are now being cranked out at a ludicrous rate and which all have the minimal requirements to run a web server.  In the mean time a mid level solution that localizes and is cheap and easy but does not require a full upcycle is the Raspberry Pi, especially the Zero W, which only costs 10 dollars and can run a decent web server.  This can be installed in an unobtrusive location on a local wifi network for truly local web networking.</p>
