<h2>Metamap Node Marker</h2>
<p>
Everything we do in the Watershed Network is at a Node, which has a position in physical space that exists on some instance of the Metamap.  
</p>
<p>
Nodes have a physical marker, generally a piece of trash, a stick or a rock or brick or bit of concrete.  Do not mark permanent things which will annoy people!  Our goal is to harmoniously co exist with all people so that they want to have us around, and while we do not respect the <em>idea</em> of private property, we should respect the <em>people</em> who exist in that system and avoid conflict by not painting things that can't be moved and which are "owned" by someone.  Thus painting a parking block is not good, but painting a shard already broken off from a parking block, which we put out of the way somewhere is good.  Sticks are really ideal, though, as they can be used as a stake driven into the ground, but also moved around, and incorporated into other structures.  
</p>
<p>
    The information on a Node Marker will be the hashtag that indicates the map, e.g. #metamapdc, any other hashtag keywords or specific descriptors such as #pennave or #kingstreet or of a specific node such as #navymemorial, a URL where the node is represented on the Metamap, a email address which will cc someone who is a caretaker of this node, and a set of coordinates in the format @(x,y).  Each marker will also have the Watershed Network symbol, with the blue triangle and blue water waves and the black and yellow diagonal stripes which represent the Trash Feed of legacy industrial systems.
