<h2>Principles of Action</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Leave things better than we found them.  Clean up messes made on the Street, but also metabolize trash as found into our System.</li>
    <li>Create positive value for physical neighbors, whoever they may be.  If we are working outside a shop of some kind, we should be actively promoting that shop, if someone else is telling people their story outside a Metro stop, we'll help them get their message out.  If there are people in need nearby in a park, without food or shelter, we'll try to help them out in any way we can.</li>
    <li>No interviews. If the press wants to learn they can actively participate and write about their own experiences.</li>
    <li>No investors.  If a person or company with money wants to contribute they can actively participate, either directly distributing money to participants or using their money for bulk orders of physical feedstock we need to grow the Network.  We have no intellectual property or equity to sell, and no corporate structure to take on debt so there is literally no way to invest.</li>
    <li>No employees.  We are all active participants in this Network.  If you want to pass money to someone because they need it, just do that.  If you want to get more money from the public by hustling more, with more people, just get together and do that.  No contracts.  Just do.</li>
    <li>No debt.  If someone gives you money they give it to you.  You don't "owe" them anything.  And the same holds for whoever you give money to:we give or do not give, we never use debt as a concept.</li>
    <li>Assume that we all get our own branches on the tree that is this Network.  That is, when someone with vastly different world views from yours is learning, help them to change the System as needed to reflect their values, as well as to be robust enough that they can transmit this new version themselves.</li>
    <li>Never willingly participate in the "intellectual property" system in any way. Never agree to have your name on any patent or copyright or trademark within this Network.  "We" do not "own" any of this.  It is Public Domain, which has a clear legal status.  Should anyone attempt to remove this work from Public Domain by applying copyright or patent to it, we won't send a cease and desist letter as we have no corporate structure and no lawyers.  We will instead refer any such fraud to the FBI or other appropriate authorities for criminal prosecution.</li>

</ul>
