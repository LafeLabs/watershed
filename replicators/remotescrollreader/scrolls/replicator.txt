<h2>Remote Scroll Reader</h2>

<p>
Put a URL in the input at the top of the screen and hit enter and this document is replaced by the scroll at that url.  If that has some kind of weird non scroll like html code, it will have unexpected results. 
</p>
<p>
    This, alone, is possibly functioning social media.  It has a scroll editor, editor editor, scroll reader, and if it's on a server live on the web, it can share scrolls with others. 
</p>
<p>
    If used with one-user-one-server this is not that powerful.  The power comes from aligning scroll nodes with <em>things</em> in the world.  Things made of things, where each thing has a scroll.  When the system is fully deployed there will be several hundred to even tens of thousands of things for each person in the system. Each thing will have many component things, all linked to other thigns that they're part of.

    Images are posed on remote servers, and linked to via img elements.  The editor relies on the ACE editor JavaScript library.  SVG's are treated as just another image.
