    Capitalist math is a set of <em>beliefs</em>, with no empirical basis, which constitute the dominant world view in technocratic society.  Those beliefs include:
<ul>
    <li>Integer numbers are "real"</li>
    <li>Infinity is real in certain situations(the "real" numbers) and not in others(geometry of infinitesimal without numbers)</li>
    <li>Human value can be connected to number always.</li>
</ul>
