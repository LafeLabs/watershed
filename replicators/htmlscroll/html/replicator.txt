<h1>Replicators</h1>

<h2>A Note On Replicators</h2>

<p>
    Replicators are methods of replicating parts of a technology.  These explanations may appear dense and a little daunting.  Do not fear!  The methods of transmission of these components are intended to be primarily directly from person to person.  If you find that you are reading this file alone, and are confused, find a physical instance of a thing that already exists, use it's "story" or "tale" documentation to find it's creator, contact that person, and get them to show and tell you directly, face to face, how to do it.  
    </p>
<p>
    These instructions may seem complex at first, but they are much simpler than numerous skills we as humans have kept in oral societies for centuries, which people in those societies are all able to become proficient in.  Part of the goal of this project is to build ways of building and transmitting things that are correctly described not as "technology" like assembling a new smart phone at a factory, but as "culture", like cooking or building traditional wooden furniture.  Also, a more cultural and less technological path to replicating machines and information systems will allow for very rapid mutations of all aspects of the things, enabling them to improve and adapt as needed. 
</p>


<h2>Physical Card</h2>
<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/Q8BOefb.jpg"/>
<p>
Physical Cards are drawn to be self-replicated with almost no external tools: no computer, no phone, no precision drafting tools, even including a ruler.  The card is itself the main drafting tool, providing the right angles and measurement required to duplicate coordinates of all the main points on the map.  
</p>

<p>
    To replicate a card, you first find a piece of cardstock that is at least the size of the card you're copying.  Trace the source card onto the destination card with a pen or pencil, then cut it out carefully with scissors to the proper shape. When you have the layout shape copied, line up the edges, and one by one trace the tic marks on all four sides of the new card from those on the old card.
</p>
<p>
    With all tic marks in place, label them by hand, copying the numbers on the source card. This defines the scope and scale of the card.  Then look at the back of the source card to get the values of the various markers on this map, which will be of the format @(x,y), where x is the value on the "x" direction, by default the shorter of the two card side lengths(the card has "portrait" not "landscape" orientation by default).  When making note of these points, you can copy them by hand onto the "back" of the new card, along with the title of this card, the hashtag that identifies the Metamap instance, and any other relevant data including web links.
</p>
<p>
    Having copied the back side of the card, go back to the map graphics side you started with, which has the tic marks and coordinate labels, and make clear marks with a pen at each of the various marker points, using the source card as a drafting tool to get right angles, and correct alignments relative to existing marks on the source card.  With markers in place, draw major black pen lines first, then color in with crayon, colored pencil, paint or whatever you have available to add color to the map card.
</p>
<p>
    This completes the base map card structure, and you can now add any further information you want to transmit with this card: places, things, ideas, nodes and flows on networks, messages, etc.
</p>


<h2>Location Value</h2>

<p>
    The smallest bit of information we use in the Metamap system is the "location", which is a string of text of the form #hashtag @(x,y).  The hashtag is referencing a Metamap instance which has an implied zero point, or origin, which is at @(0,0), as well as a "unit" value, generally in feet.  The details of the Metamap instance are specified in a block of code that should already be in a calculator that you use to compute location.
</p> 
<p>
    To make a location, we either use a map like Google maps or the GPS of a phone(which can also be Google maps).  On Google maps, zoom in enough that you think you can find your location by the precision you care about( usually about 30-50 feet), and click on the map so that the map's marker is there.  This should cause the latitude and longitude to appear in decimal degrees at the bottom of the screen. Click on that number pair and it will appear in the search box of Google maps.  Now select that whole input area with our mouse or finger or whatever you're using as a pointer, and copy that number pair to the clipboard.  It will be a number like " 38.889465, -77.035205".  Note that by default Google and various GPS software specify a absurd number of digits of precision.  Four decimal places is a 10 yard precision, which is about the most you can expect from GPS in most situations.  Six implies a few inches, but our calculator software will round appropriately and the extra digits do no harm.
</p>
<p>
    With the coordinates in the clipboard go to the calculator at <a href = "http://www.lafelabs.org/metamap/">http://www.lafelabs.org/metamap/</a> and paste the coordinates in the "latlon1" field.  Hit "enter" or the equivalent on your phone softkeys.  As soon as you hit enter you should see the coordinates in the x,y field.  Now hit the button called "copy # @( )" to copy the location to the clipboard in the appropriate format and we're ready to use the location.  You can write it down if you're working on a map object by hand, or paste it into a social media platform like Instagram or Twitter which uses hashtags, or in a scroll document in our system of decentralized social media.

<h2>Create a New Physical Card Design</h2>
<p>
To create a new physical card design on an existing Metamap instance, go out and walk around and see the space you are interested in, and decide what physical markers stand out as being the most important.  What you care about in this process is determined by what you are going to be doing with your cards.  As a general rule, though, the best choices are things that are <em>both</em> easy to spot when out walking around and also easy to see on a satellite view or map view.  
</p>
<p>
    Once you have picked your points out, and either gotten the locations from your phone GPS while walking around or from a map page like Google maps and a calculator while sitting somewhere with a Internet connection, very roughly sketch them out on a SCRATCH piece of paper you don't care about.  Compare this to the map as you see it in either Google maps or whatever maps you can find around.  
</p>
<p>
    Once you have gazed at your very rough layout and some existing map of the area you wish to cover, decide if you want to expand or shrink your map and do so as needed.  If the map is ok, find the maximum and minimum values of both x and y, and this is the "scope" of your map card.  Now, again on scratch paper(we must preserve the precious cardstock!), take a guess at a good unit size to use and mark out the number of marks in your map scope, both in x and y directions.  This is very unlikely to work well on the first try, accept that and try a few times until you have a pleasing size that looks good on the card size you're using.  
</p>
<p>
    Get the exact nature of your card size worked out based on what scrap card stock you have been able to find.  It is against the principles of this project to use newly bought paper, so this really depends on many factors.  A good "standard" size is 3.5 by 5.5 inches, with corners rounded using US dimes as templates.  
</p>
<p>
    With your locations and card sizes chosen, and your map grid size and scope, use your ruler or other measuring tool to make even tic marks on all four sides of the card, using another card with right angles as a template to get the alignment across the card right.  Then label the tics, mark the locations, and use art to build up a nice basic card design.  Flip the card over and mark the back with the hashtag of the Metamap instance your card belongs to, and list all the locations, add any Web links you need to communicate this replicator information and the story information, calculator, etc.  
</p>
<p>
    With a original card design you are ready to engage in physical trade of cards with other users.
</p>


<h2>Metamap Instance</h2>


<p>
    To instance a metamap(we use "instance" as both verb and noun in this work) is to become a creator of virtual worlds, and it requires some contemplation. The information that makes up a Metamap instance consists of a zero point, a unit, a precision, a scope, and links to all the other bits of data needed to replicate the actual components.  Given that we are usually copying an existing instance, however, for the purpose of this Replicator we simply say we've instanced a Metamap when we choose these basic numbers.  
</p>
<p>
    Choosing a zero point is highly subjective.  Walk the area, stare at the map, repeat, until you feel inside yourself that there is a center that seems natural.  In Washington DC, a logical zero point for a very localized Metamap instance is the center of "circle", such as Washington Circle, DuPont Circle, etc.  If possible, the zero point should be much more precisely defined than the overall map precision, and should be a physically identifiable marker which won't move.  The numbers you want to write down for the point are the latitude and longitude, but if you're zooming in from a map a layer up in scale, it also helps to identify the zero point as a "location" on the next map up.  For example, the zero point in the Crystal City Metamap is at #metamapdcwm @(-7,-20) on the overall DC Metamap centered at the Washington Monument and using the height of that for a unit(555 feet).   
</p>
<p>
    With a zero point, decide on a unit based on how much area you care about around that point.  Good choices are 10 yards = 30 feet, 100 yards = 300 feet, 1 mile = 5280 feet, the height of a local landmark, or the distance between two major local landmarks.  By default, in the current software, unit is in feet, although it's one line of code to change it to meters, which you should do outside the US. 
</p>
<p>
    Precision numbers are the numbers after the decimal place.  Thus if your unit precision is 1, numbers in @(x,y) notation are to the nearest tenth, and if latlon precision is 4, which it usually should be, there are 4 digits after the decimal point in latitude and longitude, making about 10 yards precision.  
</p>
<p>
    Choosing the hashtag, one starts with the word "metamap" in all lowercase, then in all one word add a simple description of your Metamap instance.  If the unit is distinctive in some way you can include that.  
</p>
<p>
    With all these numbers in hand you can just write them on a piece of paper and find someone to share it with, or email them to someone, and you're done with this basic "instancing" process.  In practice, you'll usually want to do the rest of the replication tasks in this replicator document however to make your instance maximally useful.
</p>

<h2>Web Page</h2>

<p>
The components of a Metamap instance's webpage are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The calculator
    </li>
    <li>
        The scroll reader, which has the replicator(this document), the story, which describes the story of the specific Thing, and the Object Data, which encapsulates the instance for the calculator and other software.
    </li>
    <li>
        Editors which enable the user to edit all these various components.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    There are levels of replication that you can use depending on the need.  If you are just passing a local map instance along to one person and the overall load on the server won't make much difference, just passing along the relevant Web addresses is all you need to do.
</p>
<p>
To copy the whole page to your own publicly available page do one of the following:
        Copy the code[add link] for the whole page to a local hard drive, edit it with a text editor like Visual Studio Code[link], then upload it to a web server[link] on an account you control from a hosting service like Bluehost[link] which you pay for or a free hosting service like 000webhost[link], or install Apache[link] on a Raspberry Pi[link]
</p>
<h2>Ways to Save/Load/Share/Publish/Edit Web Content</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        The easiest way by far to share web content is to simply share a link of existing content.  Write it on a piece of paper, email it, text it, post it, etc.  This is the default choice any time you're NOT trying to change any part of it, and we move up to harder choices only when changing things is needed.  
    </li>
    <li>
        The next easiest way to share web content which allows for modification is to download an html file, edit it locally on your computer or a computer you have access to at a library or something, then share the edited html file with someone via email or pasting it to a site like pastebin.com and sharing the link(this is better).
    </li>
</ul>
