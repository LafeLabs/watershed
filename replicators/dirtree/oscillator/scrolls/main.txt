<h3>Sytem Overview</h3>

<p>Oscillator is several things in one:</p>

<p>
It is the generalization of the "Ambrosia Vibe" to a generic geometric element, the octahedron, which has a panel for sensing and a panel for stimulation. 
</p>
<p>
It is also the generalization of what I was calling the "Ultimate Wand", a new type of motor based on resonance and permanent magnets.
</p>
<p>
    Oscillator is also an educational tool to teach people with no technical background to use code to control hardware.  This includes learning to use a knob, a button, simple ramp functions, and control of neopixel LED arrays.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, the culmination of the educational function is the construction of the chaos-o-tron, a chaotic pendulum based vibrator with deterministic noise. This gives an insight into the generalized pendulum system which exists in all aspects of Nature.
