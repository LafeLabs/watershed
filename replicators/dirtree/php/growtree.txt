//growing a tree means using the tree dna file to mkdir all the various directories the right number of levels down, the identifying and placing the correct replicator.php file in each one.  That's all.
//from there the user will go through and manually use replicator.php to replicate each, top level has links to replicator.php files
//after tree is grown, it is replicated by a separate php command, which copies all the files based on all the dna's through the tree using the dna of the overalltree
