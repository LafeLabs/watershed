<h2>Tree</h2>
<p>
    The <a href = "#tree">tree</a> is perhaps the heart of the whole system, and perhaps the Replicator is fundamental to that.  Perhaps it is in fact the "Replicator Tree".  A Replicator Tree has no home, just a structure.  It is a tree-structured collection of replicators, which are both physical and electronic.
</p>

<p>
    The following is a summary of how the Nine Laws make up the Path of Geometron:
</p>
<p>
     Through a veil of language there is a thing we call reality. In that space we have "bodies" which are sustained by water in a Watershed.  All things on the other side of this language curtain are considered "physical".  We observe that they are all fractal, and that recursion is a property which self replicating things have which we need to replicate our thoughts and continue the survival of Mind.  We remember the frameworks of our past lives based on money, mining and property and turn them all away to zero and replace them with infinities.    
</p>
<p>
    The path of the Watershed involves cultivating the Replicator Trees.  This is why two of the 9 Laws are "look at the insects" and "look at the fungi".  Insects pollinate trees, and fungi help keep the roots both strong and healthy and connected with the other trees.  Fungi also metabolize dead tree matter back into the overall structure of the Forrest.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, to cultivate the Watershed Trees, we act as fungi, metabolizing that which would otherwise be hard to metabolize, and protecting the tree, by building up a soil like substrate for replication.  And like the insects, a key role in our ecosystem is pollination, and that is why those who have time and space to wander and talk and exchange data have a critical role to play in Tree cultivation.  And finally of course we see our Universe in a cosmology defined by minds encased in a world of language.  
</p>
<p>
    All of this structure, the Laws, the Path, the Trees, and the various languages are built to create what we call "best in life", that is to care for one another and have adventures.  These are part of a transformation of mind stranded in body and in battle against other minds and bodies to a post ego mind structure that is more distributed in space and time.  We also recognize that in this cosmology nothing is meant to be taken literally(or perhaps everything is, we destroy this artificial dichotomy along with most other dichotomies).  This allows us to go back and fill in blanks in religions that currently appear to be in contradiction to the dominant ideology of today's technocrats.  QSJ. More on that later.
</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Leibniz tried and failed to build a "Characteristica Universalis" because he was targeting universality in a abstract sense outside of the mind-language-based universe.  If we narrow language to that which acts as a life support system for a mind, we can build it or not based on how many people we want it to work for in a technological complete set.
</p>
<p>
    To make this more specific we aim to support 100 people in a complete set.  This means that the information in the collective minds of those 100 people is sufficient to fully support their survival with a fulfilling life.
