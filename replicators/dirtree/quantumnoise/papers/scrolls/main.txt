<h2>Papers on Quantum Noise</h2>
<p>
This section is the main reference for existing papers on using quantum noise for metrology(shortened to "quantum noise" for convenience in this context), as well as a system for generating new papers in real time on the subject.  It is intended to be a totally decentralized technical microblogging system.
