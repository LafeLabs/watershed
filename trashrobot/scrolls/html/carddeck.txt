<h2>Card Deck</h2>

Each packet of information has a physical card which summarizes it.  Cards are made of cardstock, drawn with a pen then colored in with crayons, colored pencils, or paints.  Cards should be the same size so they stack, and a good size is 3.5 by 5.5 inches, with radii cut from traced arcs from dimes.
